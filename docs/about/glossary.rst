   AGDC
      The Australian Geoscience Data Cube, an Australian project that developed the
      python library that became :term:`ODC`.

   API
      The Data Cube Application Programming Interface gives programmers full
      access to the capabilities of the Cube, allowing query and advanced data
      retrieval.
   
   CEOS-SEO
      Committee on Earth Observation, Systems Engineering Office

   CRS
      Coordinate Reference System

   CSIRO
      Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation


   DEA
      Digital Earth Australia is :term:`GA`'s implementation of ODC, hosted at
      the :term:`NCI`. See the user guide at http://geoscienceaustralia.github.io/digitalearthau/
      for details on how to access the platform.

   GA
      Geoscience Australia is the primary public sector geoscience organisation in Australia.
      It supports ODC through the development of Digital Earth Australia. For more
      information see http://www.ga.gov.au/dea/.

   NCI
      The Australian National Computational Infrastructure is Australia's
      national research computing facility. It provides computing facilities for
      use by Australian researchers, industry and government. For more
      information see http://www.nci.org.au/.

   HPC
      High Performance Computing. aka, a supercomputer. These days typically a cluster
      of high performance computers linked together with high speed networking.

   Landsat
      A series of US owned earth observation satellites, with freely available data.

   MODIS
      US owned earth observation satellites with freely available data.

   ODC
      Open Data Cube

   OGC
      `Open Geospatial Consortium <http://www.opengeospatial.org>`_. An organisation which
      makes geospatial standards.

   PostgreSQL
      The high performance database engine used as an index of Datasets by the
      Data Cube. It is both a relational and document database, and the Data
      Cube schema makes use of both of these capabilities.

   Python
      The programming language used to develop the Data Cube. It is easy to use
      while still allowing high performance access and processing capabilities.
      See http://www.python.org/ for more.

   USGS
      United States Geological Survey
      
   VDI
      Virtual Desktop Infrastructure is a virtual laboratory at NCI that provides a
      linux desktop environment for scientific computing. For more see
      http://vdi.nci.org.au/help.

   WMS
      Web Map Service. A standard for delivery published maps into web browsers and
      GIS software, defined by the :term:`OGC`.

   YAML
      YAML is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming
      languages. It is used for all on disk metadata files and product
      definitions in the Data Cube.

      For more information on the YAML standard see http://yaml.org/.
